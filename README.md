Reverse it Mini Challenge 7
Peer Review - Jovann Contreras

Numbers and strings get reversed I liked that it did that one thing I reconmmend though is added data validation just for the number so that it makes sure the user only type a number. I also feel that the code should of had 2 options to choose from so that I can type a number seprarately and the word. Every thing else looked good the code ran good and was easy to understand.
